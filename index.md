In recent years, there has been a surge of business interest in incorporating machine learning into various areas of medicine. This trend directly impacts the medical robotics and machine learning research communities, which are studying ways of developing algorithms for medical devices in areas like medical imaging, surgery, and shared autonomy. These interests have led to various research directions on how best to incorporate machine learning into these areas of medical devices. These include end-to-end machine-learning solutions and more modular integration of machine-learning methods into existing systems. 

However, it is of practical consideration to determine whether blue-sky machine learning research ideas align with solving the real problems faced by medical professionals and recipients of medical care. Prosthetic technologies are an example of medical applications where engineers have created impressive hardware devices that do not serve the target audience, i.e., people with disabilities. Developing machine learning solutions for medical devices is particularly challenging, where simply scaling models is impractical for on-board computers or large data sets are impossible due to population limitations (how many people have a target disorder?). 

In this workshop, we seek to bring together members of the medical robotics community and machine learning to discuss the practical considerations of deploying machine learning for areas of medical device development, including assistive care, imaging, and other related technologies. Together, we hope to address a variety of essential considerations, such as:  

1. How can machine learning enhance the quality of life of patients?
2. Is increasing the dataset size practical in medical machine learning applications? Is scale all we need to incorporate machine learning methods in medical devices? 
3. How can we design our experimental evaluations to reflect the needs of the target populations affected by a medical condition (disability, disease, or otherwise)? 
4. What assumptions should we consider when investigating machine learning applications in a medical setting? 
5. How do we go from research to real world deployment for our advances in machine learning, particularly when government approval will be of pragmatic concern for deploying such systems?
